#Time Complexity: O(m * log k)  m = no. of calls made to add()
# add funt is log n, initialization funt is n so basically O(n log n)
#Space Complexity: O(k)         min heap of size k , cause we need the kth largest element

# Your KthLargest object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = KthLargest(k, nums)
# param_1 = obj.add(val)
