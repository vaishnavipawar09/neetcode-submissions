                    area = max(area, dfs(r, c))  # Update maximum area if larger island found

        return area  # Return the largest island area

        # Implementation Steps:
        # 1. For each cell, if it's land (1) and not visited, run DFS.
        # 2. In DFS, mark visited and explore all four directions.
        # 3. Sum the area of the current island recursively.
        # 4. Keep track of the largest area encountered.
        # 5. Return the maximum area at the end.

        # Time Complexity: O(m * n)
        #   - Each cell is visited at most once.
        # Space Complexity: O(m * n)
        #   - In the worst case (all land), the recursion stack and visited set
        #     will be size O(m * n), where m and n are the grid dimensions.

# Dry Run Example:

# grid = [
#   [0,0,1,0],
#   [1,1,1,0],
#   [0,0,0,1]
# ]
#
# Step-by-step:
# - (0,2) is land and not visited: start DFS, area = 1
#   - (1,2) is land, area += 1 (total 2)
#     - (1,1) is land, area += 1 (total 3)
#       - (1,0) is land, area += 1 (total 4)
#     - (1,3), (2,1), etc. are not land or already visited.
# - (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are already visited.
# - (2,3) is land and not visited: start DFS, area = 1
# - No more unvisited land.
# - Return max area = 4
